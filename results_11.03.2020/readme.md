### Средняя ошибка моделей

По строкам идут белки, по столбцам лиганды.

Значение в ячейке - усреднённая по 6 парам ошибка MAPE (4 модели образуют 6 пар).

Ячейки для которых в данных меньше 1000 точек исключены (стоит символ X).

В папке catalogues_21x40 для каждой пары доступна визуализация экстремумов.

Среднее по всем парам: 28.2%
